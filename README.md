# Selection, recomb and pop history effects on ROH in red deer #
This folder contains all scripts used in the paper "Selection, recombination and population history effects on runs of homozygosity (ROH) in wild red deer (Cervus elaphus)", published in Heredity. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-023-00602-z 

Files included are:
- SLiM sripts used to model the effects of differing population histories, recombination rates and selection strengths on ROH distributions.
- SNP density quality control for genetic (cM) and physical (bp) snp positions.
- RCode for 3 main figures in main text.
- RCode for 2 supplementary figures .
